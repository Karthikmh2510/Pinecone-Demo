Read the chapter in the book, then test your comprehension by using cases, flash cards, and questions that cover the same topics.

      "Examiners (NBME) and the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB). The USMLE serves as the single examination system domestically and internationally for those seeking medical licensure in the United States.\n",

      "How Is the Computer-Based Test (CBT) Structured?\n",
      "The CBT Step 1 exam consists of one “optional” tutorial/simulation block \n",
      "and seven “real” question blocks of up to 40 questions per block with no more than 280 questions in total, timed at 60 minutes per block. A short 11-question survey follows the last question block. The computer begins the survey with a prompt to proceed to the next block of questions. \n",

      "What Is the CBT Like?\n",
      "Given the unique environment of the CBT, it’s important that you become familiar ahead of time with what your test-day conditions will be like. You can access a 15-minute tutorial and practice blocks at http://orientation.nbme.org/Launch/USMLE/STPF1. This tutorial interface is the same as the one you will use in the exam; learn it now and you can skip taking it during the exam, giving you up to 15 extra minutes of break time. You can gain experience with the CBT format by taking the 120 practice questions (3 blocks with 40 questions each) available online for free (https://www.usmle.org/prepare-your-exam) or by signing up for a practice session at a test center for a fee.TABLE 1.

If a given question happens to be longer than the screen, a scroll bar will appear on the right, allowing the examinee to see the rest of the question. Regardless of whether the examinee clicks on an answer choice or leaves it blank, he or she must click the “Next” button to advance to the next question.\n",
      "The USMLE features a small number of media clips in the form of audio \n",
      "and/or video. There may even be a question with a multimedia heart sound simulation. In these questions, a digital image of a torso appears on the screen, and the examinee directs a digital stethoscope to various auscultation points to listen for heart and breath sounds. The USMLE orientation materials include several practice questions in these formats. During the exam tutorial, examinees are given an opportunity to ensure that both the audio headphones and the volume are functioning properly. If you are \n",

      "The examinee can call up a window displaying normal laboratory values. \n",
      "In order to do so, he or she must click the “Lab” icon on the top part of the screen. Afterward, the examinee will have the option to choose between “Blood,” “Cerebrospinal,” “Hematologic,” or “Sweat and Urine.” The normal values screen may obscure the question if it is expanded. The examinee may have to scroll down to search for the needed lab values. You might want to memorize some common lab values so you spend less time on questions that require you to analyze these.\n",
      "The CBT interface provides a running list of questions on the left part of the \n",
      "screen at all times. The software also permits examinees to highlight or cross out information by using their mouse. There is a “Notes” icon on the top part of the screen that allows students to write notes to themselves for review at a later time. Finally, the USMLE has recently added new functionality including text magnification and reverse color (white text on black background).

If that were to happen, you should receive an email from Prometric containing notice of the cancellation and instructions on rescheduling. Visit www.prometric.com for updates regarding their COVID-19 cancellation and rescheduling policies.\n",

The eligibility period is the three-month period you have chosen to take the exam. Most US medical students attending a school which uses the two-year preclerkship curriculum choose the April–June or June–August period. Most US medical students attending a school which uses the 18-month preclerkship curriculum choose the December–February or January–March period.\n",
      "What If I Need to Reschedule the Exam?\n",
      "You can change your test date and/or center by contacting Prometric at 1-800-MED-EXAM (1-800-633-3926) or www.prometric.com. Make sure to have your CIN when rescheduling. If you are rescheduling by phone, you must speak with a Prometric representative; leaving a voicemail message will not suffice. To avoid a rescheduling fee, you will need to request a change at least 31 calendar days before your appointment. Please note that your rescheduled test date must fall within your assigned three-month eligibility period.\n",
      "When Should I Register for the Exam?\n",
      "You should plan to register as far in advance as possible ahead of your desired test date (eg, six months), but, depending on your particular test center, new dates and times may open closer to the date. Scheduling early will guarantee that you will get either your test center of choice or one within a 50-mile radius of your first choice. For most US medical students, the desired testing window correlates with the end of the preclerkship curriculum, which is around June for schools on a two-year preclerkship schedule, and around January for schools on an 18-month schedule. Thus US medical students should plan to register before January in anticipation of a June test date, or before August in anticipation of a January test date. The timing of the exam is more flexible for IMGs, as it is related only to when they finish exam preparation. Talk with upperclassmen who have already taken the test so you have real-life experience from students who went through a similar curriculum, then formulate your own strategy. `Be familiar with Prometric’s policies for \n",

      "The computer does not warn you if you are spending more than your allotted \n",
      "time for a break. You should therefore budget your time so that you can take a short break when you need one and have time to eat.

      "Your scheduling permit shows a CIN that you will need to enter to start your exam. Entering the CIN is the same as breaking the seal on a test book, and you are considered to have started the exam when you do so. However, no result will be reported if you do not complete the exam.

      "Practice testing should be done with “interleaving” (mixing of questions from different topics in a single session). Question banks often allow you to intermingle topics. Interleaved practice helps learners develop their ability to focus on the relevant concept when faced with many possibilities. Practicing topics in massed fashion (eg, all cardiology, then all dermatology) may seem intuitive, but there is strong evidence that interleaving correlates with longer-term retention and increased student achievement, especially on tasks that involve problem solving.\n",
      "5 \n",
      "In addition to using question banks, you can test yourself by arranging your notes in a question-answer format (eg, via flash cards). Testing these Q&As in random order allows you to reap the benefit of interleaved practice. Bear in mind that the utility of practice testing comes from the practice of information retrieval, so simply reading through Q&As will attenuate this benefit.\n",
      "Distributed Practice\n",
      "Also called “spaced repetition,” distributed practice is the opposite of massed practice or “cramming.” Learners review material at increasingly spaced out intervals (days to weeks to months).

      "Apps with automated spaced-repetition software (SRS) for flash cards exist for smartphones and tablets, so the cards are accessible anywhere. Proceed with caution: there is an art to making and reviewing cards. The ease of quickly downloading or creating digital cards can lead to flash card overload (it is unsustainable to make 50 flash cards per lecture!). Even at a modest pace, the thousands upon thousands of cards are too overwhelming for Step 1 preparation.

Listen to your proctors regarding any changes in instructions or testing procedures that may apply to your test site.\n",
      "If you are experiencing symptoms of illness on the day of your exam, we \n",
      "strongly recommend you reschedule. If you become ill or show signs of illness (eg, persistent cough) during the exam, the test center may prohibit you from completing the exam due to health and safety risks for test center staff and other examinees.\n",
      "Finally, remember that it is natural (and even beneficial) to be a little \n",
      "nervous. Focus on being mentally clear and alert. Avoid panic. When you are asked to begin the exam, take a deep breath, focus on the screen, and then begin. Keep an eye on the timer. Take advantage of breaks between blocks to stretch, maybe do some jumping jacks, and relax for a moment with deep breathing or stretching.\n",
      "After the Test\n",
      "After you have completed the exam, be sure to have fun and relax regardless of how you may feel. Taking the test is an achievement in itself. Remember,  `No notes, books, calculators, pagers, cell \n",

      " `STUDY MATERIALS\n",
      "Quality Considerations\n",
      "Although an ever-increasing number of review books and software are now available on the market, the quality of such material is highly variable. Some common problems are as follows:\n",
      " Certain review books are too det\n",
      "ailed to allow for review in a reasonable \n",
      "amount of time or cover subtopics that are not emphasized on the exam.\n",
      "  Many sample question books were originally written years ago and have not been adeq\n",
      "uately updated to reflect recent trends.\n",
      " Some question banks test to a level of det\n",
      "ail that you will not find on the \n",
      "exam.\n",
      "Review Books\n",
      "In selecting review books, be sure to weigh different opinions against each other, read the reviews and ratings in Section IV of this guide, examine the books closely in the bookstore, and choose carefully. You are investing not only money but also your limited study time. Do not worry about finding the “perfect” book, as many subjects simply do not have one, and different students prefer different formats. Supplement your chosen books with personal notes from other sources, including what you learn from question banks.\n",
      "There are two types of review books: those that are stand-alone titles and \n",
      "those that are part of a series. Books in a series generally have the same style, and you must decide if that style works for you. However, a given style is not optimal for every subject.\n",
      "You should also find out which books are up to date. Some recent editions \n",
      "reflect major improvements, whereas others contain only cursory changes. Take into consideration how a book reflects the format of the USMLE Step 1. \n",
      "Apps\n",
      "With the explosion of smartphones and tablets, apps are an increasingly popular way to review for the Step 1 exam. The majority of apps are compatible with both iOS and Android. Many popular Step 1 review resources (eg, UWorld, USMLE-Rx) have apps that are compatible with  `If a given review book is not working for you, \n",

      "their software. Many popular web references (eg, UpToDate) also now offer \n",
      "app versions. All of these apps offer flexibility, allowing you to study while away from a computer (eg, while traveling).\n",
      "Practice Tests\n",
      "Taking practice tests provides valuable information about potential strengths and weaknesses in your fund of knowledge and test-taking skills. Some students use practice examinations simply as a means of breaking up the monotony of studying and adding variety to their study schedule, whereas other students rely almost solely on practice. You should also subscribe to one or more high-quality question banks. \n",
      "Additionally, some students preparing for the Step 1 exam have started to \n",
      "incorporate case-based books intended primarily for clinical students on the wards or studying for the Step 2 CK exam. First Aid Cases for the USMLE Step 1 aims to directly address this need.\n",
      "After taking a practice test, spend time on each question and each answer \n",
      "choice whether you were right or wrong. There are important teaching points in each explanation. Knowing why a wrong answer choice is incorrect is just as important as knowing why the right answer is correct. Do not panic if your practice scores are low as many questions try to trick or distract you to highlight a certain point. Use the questions you missed or were unsure about to develop focused plans during your scheduled catch-up time.\n",
      "Textbooks and Course Syllabi\n",
      "Limit your use of textbooks and course syllabi for Step 1 review. Many textbooks are too detailed for high-yield review and include material that is generally not tested on the USMLE Step 1 (eg, drug dosages, complex chemical structures). Syllabi, although familiar, are inconsistent across medical schools and frequently reflect the emphasis of individual faculty, which often does not correspond to that of the USMLE Step 1. Syllabi also tend to be less organized than top-rated books and generally contain fewer diagrams and study questions.\n",
      " `TEST-TAKING STRATEGIES\n",
      "Your test performance will be influenced by both your knowledge and your test-taking skills. You can strengthen your performance by considering each of these factors. Test-taking skills and strategies should be developed and perfected well in advance of the test date so that you can concentrate on the test itself. We suggest that you try the following strategies to see if they might work for you. `Most practice exams are shorter and less \n",

      "Pacing\n",
      "You have seven hours to complete up to 280 questions. Note that each one-\n",
      "hour block contains up to 40 questions. This works out to approximately 90 seconds per question. We recommend following the “1 minute rule” to pace yourself. Spend no more than 1 minute on each question. If you are still unsure about the answer after this time, mark the question, make an educated guess, and move on. Following this rule, you should have approximately 20 minutes left after all questions are answered, which you can use to revisit all of your marked questions. Remember that some questions may be experimental and do not count for points (and reassure yourself that these experimental questions are the ones that are stumping you). In the past, pacing errors have been detrimental to the performance of even highly prepared examinees. The bottom line is to keep one eye on the clock at all times!\n",
      "Dealing with Each Question\n",
      "There are several established techniques for efficiently approaching multiple choice questions; find what works for you. One technique begins with identifying each question as easy, workable, or impossible. Your goal should be to answer all easy questions, resolve all workable questions in a reasonable amount of time, and make quick and intelligent guesses on all impossible questions. Most students read the stem, think of the answer, and turn immediately to the choices. A second technique is to first skim the answer choices to get a context, then read the last sentence of the question (the lead-in), and then read through the passage quickly, extracting only information relevant to answering the question. This can be particularly helpful for questions with long clinical vignettes. Try a variety of techniques on practice exams and see what works best for you. If you get overwhelmed, remember that a 30-second time out to refocus may get you back on track.\n",
      "Guessing\n",
      "There is no penalty for wrong answers. Thus no test block should be left with unanswered questions. If you don’t know the answer, first eliminate incorrect choices, then guess among the remaining options. Note that dozens of questions are unscored experimental questions meant to obtain statistics for future exams. Therefore, some questions may seem unusual or unreasonably difficult simply because they are part of the development process for future exams.\n",
      "Changing Y our Answer\n",
      "The conventional wisdom is not to second-guess your initial answers. However, studies have consistently shown that test takers are more likely to change from a wrong answer to the correct answer than the other way around. Many question banks tell you how many questions you changed from right to wrong, wrong to wrong, and wrong to right. Use this feedback  `Time management is an important skill for \n",

      "the question stem and make sure you didn’t misinterpret the question.\n",
      " `CLINICAL VIGNETTE STRATEGIES\n",
      "In recent years, the USMLE Step 1 has become increasingly clinically oriented. This change mirrors the trend in medical education toward introducing students to clinical problem solving during the basic science years. The increasing clinical emphasis on Step 1 may be challenging to those students who attend schools with a more traditional curriculum.\n",
      "What Is a Clinical Vignette?\n",
      "A clinical vignette is a short (usually paragraph-long) description of a patient, including demographics, presenting symptoms, signs, and other information concerning the patient. Sometimes this paragraph is followed by a brief listing of important physical findings and/or laboratory results. The task of assimilating all this information and answering the associated question in the span of one minute can be intimidating. So be prepared to read quickly and think on your feet. Remember that the question is often indirectly asking something you already know.\n",
      "A pseudovignette is a question that includes a description of a case similar to \n",
      "that of a clinical vignette, but it ends with a declarative recall question; thus the material presented in the pseudovignette is not necessary to answer the question. Question writers strive to avoid pseudovignettes on the USMLE Step 1. Be prepared to tackle each vignette as if the information presented is important to answer the associated question correctly.\n",
      "Strategy\n",
      "Remember that Step 1 vignettes usually describe diseases or disorders in their most classic presentation. So look for cardinal signs (eg, malar rash for lupus or nuchal rigidity for meningitis) in the narrative history. Be aware that the question will contain classic signs and symptoms instead of buzzwords. Sometimes the data from labs and the physical exam will help you confirm or reject possible diagnoses, thereby helping you rule answer choices in or out. In some cases, they will be a dead giveaway for the diagnosis.\n",
      "Making a diagnosis from the history and data is often not the final answer. Not \n",
      "infrequently, the diagnosis is divulged at the end of the vignette, after you have just struggled through the narrative to come up with a diagnosis of your own. The question might then ask about a related aspect of the diagnosed disease. Consider skimming the answer choices and lead-in before diving into a long stem. However, be careful with skimming the answer choices; going too fast may warp your perception of what the vignette is asking. `Go with your first hunch, unless you are \n",

There are several sensible steps you can take to plan for the future in the event that you do not achieve a passing score.

Major topics such as inflammation and neoplasia appear frequently in questions across different organ systems, and such topics are definitely high yield. For example, the concepts of cell injury and inflammation are key to understanding the inflammatory response that follows myocardial infarction, a very common subject of board questions. Similarly, a familiarity with the early cellular changes that culminate in the development of neoplasias—for example, esophageal or colon cancer—is critical. Make sure you recognize the major tumor-associated genes and are comfortable with key cancer concepts such as tumor staging and metastasis.

      "A heterogenous mix of epidemiology, biostatistics, ethics, law, healthcare delivery, patient safety, quality improvement, and more falls under the heading of public health sciences. Biostatistics and epidemiology are the foundations of evidence-based medicine and are very high yield. Make sure you can quickly apply biostatistical equations such as sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values in a problem-solving format. Also, know how to set up your own 2 × 2 tables, and beware questions that switch the columns. Quality improvement and patient safety topics were introduced a few years ago on the exam and represent trends in health system science. Medical ethics questions often require application of principles. Typically, you are presented with a patient scenario and then asked how you would respond. In this edition, we provide further details on communication skills and patient care given their growing emphasis on the exam. Effective communication is essential to the physician-patient partnership. Physicians must seek opportunities to connect with patients, understand their perspectives, express empathy, and form shared decisions and realistic goals.Public Health Sciences\n",

      "Embryology\n",
      "Relevant embryology is included in each organ system subsection. Embryology tends to correspond well with the relevant anatomy, especially with regard to congenital malformations.\n",
      "Anatomy\n",
      "Several topics fall under this heading, including gross anatomy, histology, and neuroanatomy. Do not memorize all the small details; however, do not ignore anatomy altogether. Review what you have already learned and what you wish you had learned. Many questions require two or more steps. The first step is to identify a structure on anatomic cross section, electron micrograph, or photomicrograph. The second step may require an understanding of the clinical significance of the structure.\n",

      " related to specific d\n",
      "iseases \n",
      "(eg, Pancoast tumor, Horner syndrome), traumatic injuries (eg, fractures, sensory and motor nerve deficits), procedures (eg, lumbar puncture), and common surgeries (eg, cholecystectomy). There are also many questions on the exam involving x-rays, CT scans, and neuro MRI scans. Many students suggest browsing through a general radiology atlas, pathology atlas, and histology atlas. Focus on learning basic anatomy at key levels in the body (eg,  sagittal brain MRI; axial CT of the midthorax, abdomen, and pelvis). Basic neuroanatomy (especially pathways, blood supply, and functional anatomy), associated neuropathology, and neurophysiology have good yield. Please note that many of the photographic images in this book are for illustrative purposes and are not necessarily reflective of Step 1 emphasis.\n",
      "Physiology\n",
      "The portion of the examination dealing with physiology is broad and concept oriented and thus does not lend itself as well to fact-based review. Diagrams are often the best study aids, especially given the increasing number of questions requiring the interpretation of diagrams.

      "A large portion of the physiology tested on the USMLE Step 1 is clinically \n",
      "relevant and involves understanding physiologic changes associated with pathologic processes (eg, changes in pulmonary function with COPD). Thus, it is worthwhile to review the physiologic changes that are found with common pathologies of the major organ systems (eg, heart, lungs, kidneys, GI tract) and endocrine glands.\n",
      "Pathology\n",
      "Questions dealing with this discipline are difficult to prepare for because of the sheer volume of material involved. Review the basic principles and hallmark characteristics of the key diseases. Given the clinical orientation of Step 1, it is no longer sufficient to know only the “buzzword” associations of certain diseases (eg, café-au-lait macules and neurofibromatosis); you must also recognize the clinical descriptions of these high-yield physical exam findings.\n",
      "Given the clinical slant of the USMLE Step 1, it is also important to \n",
      "review the classic presenting signs and symptoms of diseases as well as their associated laboratory findings. Delve into the signs, symptoms, and pathophysiology of major diseases that have a high prevalence in the United States (eg, alcohol use disorder, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, infectious disease). Be prepared to think one step beyond the simple diagnosis to treatment or complications. \n",
      "The examination includes a number of color photomicrographs and \n",
      "photographs of gross specimens that are presented in the setting of a brief clinical history. However, read the question and the choices carefully before looking at the illustration, because the history will help you identify the pathologic process. Flip through an illustrated pathology textbook, color atlases, and appropriate Web sites in order to look at the pictures in the days before the exam. Pay attention to potential clues such as age, sex, ethnicity, occupation, recent activities and exposures, and specialized lab tests.\n",
      "Pharmacology\n",
      "Preparation for questions on pharmacology is straightforward. Learning all the key drugs and their characteristics (eg, mechanisms, clinical use, and important adverse effects) is high yield. Focus on understanding the prototype drugs in each class. Avoid memorizing obscure derivatives. Learn the “classic” and distinguishing toxicities of the major drugs. Do not bother with drug dosages or brand names. Reviewing associated biochemistry, physiology, and microbiology can be useful while studying pharmacology. There is a strong emphasis on ANS, CNS, antimicrobial, and cardiovascular agents as well as NSAIDs. Much of the material is clinically relevant. Newer drugs on the market are also fair game.\n",

      "The endocrine system comprises widely distributed organs that work in a highly integrated manner to orchestrate a state of hormonal equilibrium within the body. Generally speaking, endocrine diseases can be classified either as diseases of underproduction or overproduction, or as conditions involving the development of mass lesions—which themselves may be associated with underproduction or overproduction of hormones. Therefore, study the endocrine system first by learning the glands, their hormones, and their regulation, and then by integrating disease manifestations with diagnosis and management. Take time to learn the multisystem connections.EndocrineSECTION III\n",
